# PIXEL-AGE

<div align="justify"> 
PIXEL-AGE is a browser-based online multiplayer fighting game (2-player game). Players can play the game with their friends or engage in random battles with opponents from around the world. To initiate a game with friends, players can create a private lobby and share the lobby code with their friends. This allows players to easily join the same game and compete against each other. Alternatively, players can quickly match up with random opponents using the "Play Online" feature. The game also has an in-game chat feature.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install all the dependencies using install-all script:

```
cd PIXEL-AGE
npm run install-all
```

The install-all script will install all the dependencies required for both the backend and frontend code.

### Configuring Environment Variables

- Copy .env.example file and rename it to .env.
- Open the .env file and update the variables according to your environment.

### Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are configured, you can run the complete project. This involves starting both the backend Express server and the frontend React server. Make sure you are in the main directory, which is PIXEL-AGE:

```
npm run start
```

Alternatively, you can start the backend Express server or the frontend React server separately using the following scripts:

```
npm run start-backend
npm run start-frontend
```

Running npm run start will launch both servers concurrently, allowing you to interact with the complete project. Use the separate scripts if you need to run each server individually.
